In particular, we seek the equations of motion for two body dynamics. In the limit that one black hole is much larger than the other, we can describe the smaller black hole as a particle following geodesics of the Schwarzschild metric around the larger black hole. We shall now proceed to describe how the two body problem can thus be reduced to an effective one-body problem.
