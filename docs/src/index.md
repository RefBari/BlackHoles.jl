# Neural DynAMO Project: Extracting Orbital Dynamics from Binary Black Holes

Binary Black Holes are a fascinating physical system, unifying the small (amplitudes on the order of $\sim 10^{-21}$) and the grand (lumonisities $>10^{47}$ ergs, brighter than all the stars in the universe!)

## Quick start
```julia
pkg> add https://github.com/RefBari/BlackHoles.jl
using BlackHoles
